Part 1) EDA and Visualisation of COVID-19 and its spread.ipynb

	The given code file contains data anlaysis of spread of COVID-19. The data used here is downloaded from John Hopkins University directory which gets renewed everyday. The code
	contains plots that tracks growth of no of cases and deaths with time and compares various European countries. Beside this, with the help of data analysis we also try to find out
	which country had the highest and lowest mortality rates and current situtation in every country compared to the peak when daily no of recoreded cases were highest.


Part 1) EDA and Visualisation of mobility data during COVID-19.ipynb

	The given code file contains data anlysis of observed mobility during the COVID-19 phase i.e. from February of 2020 to current date. The data used here is taken from Google
	mobility report and cleaned to fit the required criteria. The code contains plots that track change in day to day mobility  various countries population of Europe and overall
	change of all European countries combined.

Part 1) EDA and Visualisation of vaccination of COVID-19.ipynb

	The given code file contains data analysis of vaccnation process of COVID-19. The data used here is taken from Kaggle. the code contains plots that track the growth of vaccination
	process in the various European countries. The code also compared the various types of vaccines available and territoris where they are used by majority of population.


Part 2) Prediction of COVID-19 cases.ipynb

	The given code file contains prediction of no of confirmed COVID-19 cases based on the data we used in part 1. We use 5  different Machine Learning models and compare their results 
	with each other and with the original no of observed cases. After that we also try to predict no of cases that according to these models we can expect in the next 30 days.

Part 3) Effect of vaccination on COVID-19.ipynb

	The given code file contains qualitative and quantitative analysis of effect of vaccination on spread of COVID-19 and on the no. of deaths caused by the virus. For this first we plot
	grphs depicting the no of cases and deaths observed before and after the start of vaccination. To form a strong hypothesis we also plot graphs depicting cases and deaths before and
	after completion of 10% of vaccination. Finally we use Holt's Winter model to check our hypothesis and we arrive at a conclusion that vaccination is resulting in lowering of no of
	deaths.


The codes were written on Kaggle and can be run on the same.
